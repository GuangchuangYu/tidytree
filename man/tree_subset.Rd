\title{Subset tree objects by related nodes}
\usage{
tree_subset(tree, node, levels_back = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{a tree object of class phylo}

\item{node}{either a tip label or a node number for the given
tree that will be the focus of the subsetted tree}

\item{levels_back}{a number specifying how many nodes back from
the selected node the subsetted tree should include}
}
\description{
This function allows for a tree object to be subset by specifying a
node and returns all related nodes within a selected number of
levels
}
\details{
This function will take a tree and a specified node from
that tree and subset the tree showing all relatives back to a specified
number of nodes. This function allows for a combination of
\link{\code{ancestor}} and \link{\code{offspring}} to return a subsetted
tree that is of class phylo. This allows for easy graphing of the tree
with \code{ggtree}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  nwk <- system.file("extdata", "sample.nwk", package="treeio")
  tree <- read.tree(nwk)

  sub_tree <- tree_subset(tree, node = "A", levels_back = 3)
  ggtree(sub_tree) + geom_tiplab() + geom_nodelab()
}
